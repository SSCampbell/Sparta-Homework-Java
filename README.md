# Sparta Global Academy Homework -- JavaScript Calculator

## Project Review:

### In this project I had to create a Calculator using the basic JavaScript skills currently reviewed.

## Project Download:  
### Download from the files created and transferred to GITHUB
### The repository was created on GITHUB and cloned to access from terminal  
### Used a JS file & HTML file

## Using JavaScript tools such as:
```JavaScript
firstP_n = prompt("What Is Your First Number: ");
secondP_n = prompt("What Is Your Second Number: ");
numPow_n = Math.pow(Number(firstP_n),Number(secondP_n));
alert(firstP_n + " ^" + secondP_n + " = " + numPow_n);

while () {};
```

## Creating the basic Calculator was possible as the basic operators such as ADD and SUB can be implemented using simple code. The advanced Calculator used other functions from the maths library built into the program. On the other hand, the BMI Calculator was created manually from operators stringed together. One of the difficulties I found was creating an effective WHILE loop that can allow the user to repeat the prompt question if the answer inputted was wrong.
