SUPER Bonus task
Add the following calculator feature into your app.
Trip Calculator
This feature asks the user for four inputs; distance, fuel efficiency (mpg), cost per gallon, speed and it will give you the time and price of your journey.
Example output: "Your trip will take 3.5 hours and cost Â£255.33.""
Note: For every 1 MPH over 60 MPH, reduce the the MPG by 2 MPG (i.e. a car that normally gets 30 mpg would only get 28 mpg if its speed were 61 mph. Yes this gets silly at high speed where mpg goes to zero or gets negative - how will you handle this?)
